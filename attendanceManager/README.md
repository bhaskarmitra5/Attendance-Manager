** Name of the mobile application is "ATTENDANCE MANAGER". The idea is to manage attendance of students which will ease the    life of students and save them problem of wasting time running before professors to know their attendance at times of      exams(one of the problems which i faced). It can also be extended to notify users about their timetable like this below    example.
    - hey user, u have DBMS class tomorrow at 9:15.. would u like me to wake u up in the morning..    

** Can be used to show warning message when the attendance falls below a certain %age..

** Also can be used to find out how many classes can be bunked without any danger.

** Sending inspirational quotes

** Maintaining this reccord will be beneficial also for those who have not enough attendance to make it to xams as it would    help them if they want to provide fake medical leave which was earlier not possible because professors refuse to show      them the attendance registers to find out the dates for which they were absent.



TECHNOLOGY STACK:

1)Ionic framework for hybrid mobile app 
2)angularJS :- supported by Ionic

--------------------------------------HOW T0 INSTALL---------------------------------------------------------------


1)  To start with, make sure the ionic utility is installed:

        $ npm install -g ionic

2)  Now we have to add a platform for ionic application to be build on. Remember Ionic is a hybrid mobile application          development software, we have to add platform and build it for that particular platform. To add android platform:

        $ ionic platform add android

3)  Then we have to install all dependencies listed in package.json:

        $ ionic state restore

4)  We are ready to go. We can test our application by:

        $ ionic serve

5)  Build apk file by following command(this requires android sdk):

        $ ionic build android

6)  To test in android device or emulator, we connect android device to the computer and run:

        $ ionic run android

7)  The apk file can be found from '/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk' and can be manually installed..

---------------------------------------------  ABOUT ME     --------------------------------------------------


DURATION OF INTERSHIP......................

I am looking for 2 months summer internship from 10th may to 10th july.
I am Willing to move to bangalore for the internship.



MY VIEW ABOUT FINOMENA.....................

    Finomena is a fast growing finance based start-up company which provides access to flexible credit for youngsters which they cannot get normally. Finomena has brought revolution in India from the view of a borrower, for their personal and professional growth. We can buy anything with the FMI provided by Finomena. Now we can be financially independent and financially literate, thus revolutionizing the way banking is done today. Its a really impressive idea to come up with and i would love to work for Finomena.



PROJECTS I MAY GET TO WORK ON.............

    Being a start-up, any employee can be asked to do any task. This is what i love about start-ups as we get exposure to different technologies and not only for the domains we are hired for.

    So as for now i can get projects on mobile pplication development. As i know hybrid app development(IONIC Framework) i may be asked to make the native mobile application of Finomena to hybrid application.

    May be asked to build a good UI/UX. I know angularJS and have a internship on AngularJS,IONIC and Django so i may help build Finomena an awesome dynamic single-page frontend with modularized codes.

    Also i am good at python and i know Django and may be assigned to build a backend for Finomena application and the Rest API for the application.
    Also each user's transaction should be isolated as any error in transaction is not acceptable as this can be of harm to the company. Work on authentication will be there as it is a banking based company any compromise on user's details may cost us money and the customers too.

    Project on making transaction faster.

    May be Finomena on a later date want to start e-commerce as well so there may project to build a e-commerce site and application for it and synching e-commerce with e-banking.




MY STRENGTHS........................

    I am a fast learner. I am friendly in nature. I make people around me comfortable. I don't find it much difficult interacting with new people. I am a member of Dance Club of my college therefore i can work in group and co-operate with other group members. I have prior experience of corporate life. I like to accept challenging projects so that i can learn new stuffs. I had my second year summer internship on Ionic Framework and AngularJS. My time management skills are good. I m persistent dont give up easily.




MY WEAKNESSES......................

    I like to complete things by knowing things in details. Therefore sometimes i get delayed due to this habit of mine.



MY WISHES.........................

    I never got chance to work on BIG DATA and IoT and would like to work on these things.




CHALLENGES FACED ON PREVIOUS PROJECTS.......................

    Surviving the second year summer internship was probably my biggest achievent so far as i was exposed to corporate life for the first time and that too in a start-up. The amount of workload and pressure there is undescribeable. I was assigned to build a hybrid mobile web application with IONIC Framework named "FORMSTORE" which provides various forms within the app only under location, category of application, type of organisation.
    Faced difficulty in connecting API to the application. But i managed to complete my task and at the end of the intership i was satisfied with my performance and my pressure handling abilities has increased.



THINGS I LEARNED FROM MY INTERNSHIP........................

    Doing tasks in group is fun and "NOT TO GIVE UP ON ANYTHING, EVENTUALLY YOU WILL GET IT" as i felt like quitting sometime but pulled myself and did not quit.
