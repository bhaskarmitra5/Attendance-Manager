**Idea is to make a attendancesheet manager which will ease the life of students and save them problem of wasting time running before professors to know their attendance at times of exams(one of the problems which i faced). It can also be extended to notify users about their timetable like this below example.
    - hey user, u have DBMS class tomorrow at 9:15.. would u like me to wake u up in the morning..    

**can be used to show warning message when the attendance falls below a certain %age..

**also can be used to find out how many classes can be bunked without any danger.

**sending inspirational quotes

**maintaining this reccord will be beneficial also for those who have not enough attendance to make it to xams as it would help them if they want to  provide fake medical leave which was earlier not possible because  profs refuse to show them the attendance registernot

**authentication required to open the app , therefore friendship cant effect it.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:

1)Ionic framework for hybrid mobile app
2)angularJS :- supported by Ionic

------------------------------------------------------HOW T0 INSTALL-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  To start with, make sure the ionic utility is installed:

        $ npm install -g ionic

2)  Now we have to add a platform for ionic application to be build on. Remember Ionic is a hybrid mobile application development software, we
    have to add platform and build it for that particular platform. To add android platform:
        $ ionic platform add android

3)  Then we have to install all dependencies listed in package.json:
        $ ionic state restore

4)  We are ready to go. We can test our application by:
        $ ionic serve

5)  Build apk file by following command(this requires android sdk):
        $ ionic build android

6)  To test in android device or emulator, we connect android device to the computer and run:
        $ ionic run android

7)  The apk file can be found from '/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk' and can be manually installed..
